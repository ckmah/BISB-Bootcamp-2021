# BISB Bootcamp 2021

Welcome to the course website for the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology Fall Quarter 2021 Bootcamp for incoming students to our doctoral program! 

## Course Instructors

This course is entirely taught by graduate students! There are three main instructors for the course from the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program. The main instructors teach the majority of "learning modules", along with lectures that contain helpful graduate school knoweldge. There are also quite a few guest instructors that will also be joining the course!

## Goals of the Bootcamp

This week-long Bootcamp aims to:

* Introduce new students to the Bioinformatics & Systems Biology program, its faculty and students, and research opportunities at the University of California, San Diego
* Foster student community and collaboration among students of the first-year class and to students in upper classes
* Convey the bar for the core curriculum and key classes, as well as the research excitement and work ethic characteristic of the program's best students
* Provide incoming students with an opportunity to remedy deficiencies before taking the core classes

## Bootcamp Schedule

Within this repository, each day of the BISB Bootcamp is separated into its own folder and its own `README.md` file. From there, the educational modules for that day are in their separate folders. Presentations given by the BISB Bootcamp Instructors and guest speakers will be located in the `presentations/` folder and updated as we obtain slide decks and/or presentation links.
